						operations in mainland China are represented by netease. The game is set in blizzard's world of warcraft series, where
						a total of nine warcraft characters are used as nine different classes. What the player has to do is to form an appropriate
						deck according to their existing CARDS, command heroes, drive followers, cast spells, and compete with game friends
						or unknown opponents. March 13, 2014, it was officially launched globally. Won the best mobile game of the TGA2014
						game awards in 2014 and the second SXSW game of the year in 2015.

						<p>Before the start of a game, players need to choose the existing set of CARDS to carry out Against the One set must
							be 30. After starting, the system randomly assigns the players' CARDS before and after the game, according to 3 CARDS
							of the forehand and 4 CARDS of the backhand, and then the players can change some of them to complete the opening
							game. In a match, the upper limit of the deck is 60 CARDS, and the upper limit of the round is 50 rounds. After reaching
							the upper limit, it is considered as a tie. In the skyladder mode, both parties do not lose stars and segments, but
							the winning streak is interrupted. There are no mana crystals on either side at the beginning of each turn. One full
							mana crystal will be added at the beginning of each turn, up to 10. Mana is a must for CARDS and hero skills to be
							used. Each active play of a hand must consume the amount of mana indicated in the upper left corner. The blue gem
							at the bottom right of the interface is the power crystal. The minions and weapons on the CARDS can be kept forever
							until they are eliminated or destroyed. Spells can only be used once, in which mysteries and quests remain in the
							mystery zone after being used until the effect disappears, and other spells disappear after being cast. The hero card
							disappears after replacing the hero. When there is no card in the library, every player who tries to draw a card will
							be hurt. This condition is called "fatigue". Injuries sustained through fatigue increase with the number of fatigue
							injuries.</p>
